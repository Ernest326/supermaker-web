# SuperMaker
Super Maker is a web app which allows users to create their own levels using our own built-in editor and load/share them. Super Maker uses its own library for rendering objects onto a context.

## Inspiration
Super mario maker inspired this project and also I like the idea of users being able to create their own levels and share it with their friends/test it out

## What it does
SuperMaker allows users to create their own levels with our tileset and also users are able to change other settings like gravity, speed, jump height, background and much more.

Levels can be shared in a file and loaded.

## How we built it
We made our own library for rendering onto a context and made separate classes for different components. We also have two separate classes for the editor and game which are quite similar. We use react to run the web and hop to deploy it on the cloud.

## Challenges we ran into
In the beginning we had trouble with setting up hop which took many wasted hours. Eventually we got it working and then started working on our project. Other challenges I experienced was coding the physics engine, which isn't perfect but somewhat works and managing the objects in the scene. There where also physical challenges I personally had such as my pc bluescreening/shutting off randomly today which wasted a bit of time and also real life problems. Other than that we are happy with how our project came out but I believe we could have added more features if we had hop deployed earlier.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the editor and the web game engine that we have developed. I think that this is a great achievement to complete in around 24 hours.

## What we learned
We became better at using react and javascript and also learn to adapt and overcome many challenges

## What's next for SuperMaker
Better physics engine, better editor UI, sounds/music options, more editor components, bug fixes and also maybe a web server which allows users to share their levels on the cloud and comment/rate other users levels.
